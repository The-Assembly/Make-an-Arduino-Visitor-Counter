# Make-an-Arduino-Visitor-Counter
A good, simple use case for automation for those administering event venues is a visitor counter—even more so in these times of COVID-19 and social distancing.  In this session, we’ll build a device using Arduino that will automatically sense and count the number of people entering and exiting the premises, with a convenient display attached. When the number is exceeded, the system automatically starts beeping until the situation has been remedied.  Hardware required: —Arduino UNO —Ultrasonic sensors (x2) —OLED Display —Buzzer —Jumper wires, breadboard  Software required: —Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)  -----------------------------------------  To learn more about The Assembly’s workshops, visit our website, social media or email us at workshops@theassembly.ae  Our website: http://theassembly.ae Social media: —Instagram: http://instagram.com/makesmartthings —Facebook: http://fb.com/makesmartthings —Twitter: http://twitter.com/makesmartthings  #Arduino #COVID19 #DIY
